Each person has his or her own diet based on the likes and dislikes of the user, demonstrating the significance of individual nutrition to maintain the success and health of the user.

A machine learning algorithm known as a recommender system basically predicts future behavior based on past preferences of a user. Looking back at the history of e-commerce, due to a fixed inventory because of small physical space, retailers were encouraged to stock up on the most well-liked mainstream goods. Online marketplace has revolutionized the retail industry. By narrowing the search space and selecting the most pertinent, high-quality content for consumers, recommender systems reduce choice overload. User feedback fuels recommender systems. As we learn more about a user's preferences, we can create recommendations that are more pertinent and suited to their preferences.
